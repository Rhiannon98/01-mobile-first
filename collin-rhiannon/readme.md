# Lab 01-mobile-first

**Author**: Rhiannon Mortensen && Collin Hintzke
**Version**: 2.5.2

## Overview ##
We worked with the provided comp images, wrote CSS so that the browser rendering matches the images as closely as possible. Utilized the icon fonts located in `styles/icons.css` for navigation features as shown in the comp images. Added a [`normalize.css`] file, which should be placed in a `vendor/styles/` directory, to override default browser settings that affect the way documents render. SMACSS practices to organize CSS into separate files and appropriately order the loading of those files in the `<head>` of the HTML document. Designed towards mobile web browser sizes first then to fit desktop with a fluid and responsive CSS.

## Getting Started ##
To build this app on your own machine, you must fork (or clone if not editting) to your computer to properly view the files. Reccommended that you look into the collin-rhiannon file rather than any other for it has the most functioning code within it making the HTML pages more optimal.

## Architecture ##
Languages used for this application:
- CSS & HTML primarily.
- Some images coded into the document as well.
