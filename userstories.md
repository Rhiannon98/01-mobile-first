## User Stories and Feature Tasks

*As a user, I want to have an application that looks good, is easy to use, and is updated often, so that I want to come back and use it frequently.*


*As a developer, I want to use standard industry practices for setting up and organizing the code that handles the styling of my application so that my code is easy to edit and maintain.*


*As a user, I want a familiar experience of the application so that I know how to use it on my smartphone and occasionally my laptop.*
